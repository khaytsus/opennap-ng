Advanced Installation
=====================
You can run opennap-ng as a seperate user process. Create a user named
`opennap-ng' and configure like this:

  $ ./configure --prefix=/home/opennap-ng --sysconfdir=/home \
       --datadir=/home --sbindir=/home/opennap-ng --with-uid=opennap-ng \
       --with-gid=users

This example assumes the standard groupname is `users', else check with
`$ id opennap-ng' and change accordingly. After configuring build
opennap-ng:

  $ make
  
and finally install as user opennap-ng:

  $ make install


The advantage is that all files live in the home directory of user
`opennap-ng' and the paths are hardcoded. You still can supply the option
`-c .' to opennap for running from any other directory.

If you want to give shell access to other (trusted) admins, then you only
have to grant them access to the user `opennap-ng'.
